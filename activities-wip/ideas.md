This file, along with the folder [activities-wip](.) lists specific ideas for activities. If you want to develop any of them, your contributions will be greatly appreciated! Please, read the [readme](../README.md) for more information on how to join our efforts.

* Theoretical CS and math:
	* Cards with graphs and:
		* Assigning properties to them (is planar, has a radius of 2, contains an open/closed Eulerian path, contains a Hamiltonian cycle, has a maximum degree 5, ...)
		* Or grouping related graphs (G1 is isomorphic/subgraph/spanning tree of G2)
	* Relations: cards with properties (reflexive, transitive, ...), assign definitions, examples, different representations (graph, matrix)
	* Algebraic structures (group, monoid, ...) and their properties
	* Complex proofs: cards with various lemmas that are used in specific parts of proof of a large theorem
	* Regular expressions: group strings parsed by given regular expressions
	* Function composition

* Algorithms and data structures:
	* Sorting algorithms: properties, code examples, complexity, use cases
	* In/Pre/Post order

* Generic activities:
	* Assign property cards to a given concept
	* Select all the cards related with a given concept

* Applied computing:
	* The routing game ("Poznej FI 2017")
	* ISO/OSI model of network, properties, functions

* Cybersecurity:
	* RSA encryption (OpenLab/K-SCUK)

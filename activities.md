## List of activities

This is the full list of activities in the Stack divided into several categories. The activities within each category are listed in the alphabetical order and include a brief description.

### Flagship activities

Tested in practice many times, iteratively improved, and nicely designed, these are the activities we're especially proud of.

* [Encryption modes](activities/encryption-modes/README.md) -- Learn block cipher modes of operation, their properties and use cases from scratch.
* [Incident handling: A suspicious e-mail](activities/incident-handling-suspicious-email/README.md) -- Spot an e-mail scam within a corporate scenario that really happened.

### Theoretical CS and math

Activities to learn theoretical aspects of computer science and mathematics.

* [Properties of functions](activities/properties-functions/README.md) -- Practice the concepts of injective, surjective, and bijective functions.
* [Pumping lemma for context-free languages](activities/pumping-lemma-cfl/README.md) -- Practice Pumping lemma on four progressively harder proofs.

### Algorithms and data structures

Bordering theoretical CS and practical programming, activities in this section deal with conceptual as well as applied aspects of algorithms and data structures.

* [Data structures in Python](activities/data-structures-python/README.md) -- Practice properties and use cases of basic Python data structures.
* [Live sorting algorithms](activities/sorting-algorithms/README.md) -- Fun activity in which the students experience sorting algorithms.

### Programming

If you teach programming, this is the right section for you.

* [Code puzzle](activities/code-puzzle/README.md) -- An advanced Parson's problem in C\#.
* [Data types in Python](activities/data-types-python/README.md) -- A brief practice of basic Python data types.
* [Exceptions in C#](activities/exceptions-csharp/README.md) -- Understand exceptions in C\# and when to throw/catch them.
* [Pairing students based on file commands](activities/pairing-file-commands-python/README.md) -- Quickly group students based on pairing Python file commands with their description.
* [Pairing students based on list comprehensions](activities/pairing-list-comprehensions-python/README.md) -- Quickly group students who have a Python list comprehension that generates the same list.
* [Recursion with turtle graphics](activities/recursion-turtle-graphics/README.md) -- Interactive activity for understanding recursion by using turtle graphics in Python.
* [Rubric of introductory programming skills](activities/rubric-introductory-programming-skills/README.md) -- A self-assessment of core skills at the start of an intro programming course.
* [The good, the bad, and the ugly](activities/good-bad-ugly/README.md) -- Categorize pieces of code as good, bad, or ugly.
* [Turtle graphics drawing](activities/turtle-graphics-drawing/README.md) -- A pen-and-paper drawing exercise that subsequently translates to code.

### Software engineering

Software specification, design, and analysis.

* [Software requirements warm-up](activities/software-requirements-warm-up/README.md) -- Classify requirements as functional or non-functional.
* [State diagram created together](activities/state-diagram-created-together/README.md) -- The whole class creates a UML state diagram for a given use case.

### Applied computing

Networks, operating systems, information technology, and other practical aspects of informatics and computer science.

* [Network flow monitoring](activities/network-flow-monitoring/README.md) -- Understand and practice the concept of network traffic flows.

### Cybersecurity

Cryptography, network security, and human aspects of computer security.

* [Encryption modes](activities/encryption-modes/README.md) -- Learn block cipher modes of operation, their properties and use cases from scratch.
* [Incident handling: A suspicious e-mail](activities/incident-handling-suspicious-email/README.md) -- Spot an e-mail scam within a corporate scenario that really happened.
* [Vulnerable source code](activities/vulnerable-source-code/README.md) -- Find vulnerabilities and propose fixes in C code snippets.

### Generic activities

These activities are content-agnostic and can be easily adapted for teaching various topics.

* [Creating quiz questions](activities/creating-quiz-questions/README.md) -- A homework activity for students to create own exam questions.
* [Mutual practice exam](activities/mutual-practice-exam/README.md) -- A set of activities for students to prepare for exams.

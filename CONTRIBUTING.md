## Contribution guidelines

We'll be delighted if you share your great teaching activities with the world! Please, read and follow these simple guidelines to help us maintain the quality of the activities in the Stack.

### Structure and content

Use the [template for new activities](activities/README.md). Do *not* change the template structure -- preserve all the headings in the given order.

If you attach any files, include also their source form that can be edited if necessary. For example, if you are submitting a PDF, add also the corresponding Office / LaTeX source document.

To see an exemplary submission, look at the flagship activities on the [main page](README.md).

### Language

If you are unsure about your English, we gladly accept submissions in Czech or Slovak language, too. Imperfect grammar is also not a problem, as we'll proofread all submissions.

### Putting it all together

When you are finished, open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). If you don't know how, e-mail the whole activity to Valdemar at *valdemar@mail.muni.cz*.

Thank you for making computer science classrooms better!

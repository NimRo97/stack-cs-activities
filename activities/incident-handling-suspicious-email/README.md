# Incident handling: A suspicious e-mail communication

Here comes a short and comprehensive summary of the activity (2–3 sentences).

| Parameters:        |              |
| -----------------: | :----------- |
| **Duration:**      | 30–45 minutes |
| **Participants:**  | 1–X students |
| **Instructors:**   | 1 teacher    |
| **Class:**         | any          |
| **Resources:**     | PC or the printed files |
| **Prerequisites:** | critical thinking |

## Learning outcomes

* Critically analyze an e-mail conversation to spot a scam.

## Setup and preparation

* The students will need the task [handout](incident-handling-task.pdf) and the [attachment](incident-handling-task-attachment.pdf).
	* If you have computers, send the files to the students. Avoid linking directly to this repo at the beginning, as it contains the [solution](incident-handling-task-solution.pdf).
	* If you want to go unplugged, print the handout and the attachment for each student. You can use two-sided printing.

## Activity overview

1. Provide the task handout and the attachment to students. The materials contain all the information required to solve the task. At the same time, this is all the available information. Do not answer questions that would reveal more information than is given in the handout.
2. Let the students work individually. Set the time limit according to how advanced your group is.
3. When the time runs out, ask the students how they solved the problem and what their approach was.

## Tips and tricks

* After the exercise, emphasize some common security rules:
	* E-mail headers cannot be trusted. If an e-mail appears to be from someone, it doesn't mean it is.
	* Textual signatures absolutely cannot be trusted. Just because the e-mail is signed as "Bruce Wayne", for example, it doesn't mean it is him. This might sound really obvious, but there are still people who can be tricked by this.
	* Generic greetings, such as "To Our Valued Customer", indicate that the e-mail is probably send out to many different people at once.
	* If you spot anything suspicous in the e-mail, don't click on any links or open any attachments.
	* Don't send any money online unless you really ordered something, and you are sure about who is the recipient.

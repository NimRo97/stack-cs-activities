# The good, the bad, and the ugly

The students form small groups and cooperatively categorize small pieces of code as good, bad, or ugly.

| Parameters:        |               |
| -----------------: | :------------ |
| **Duration:**      | 20 minutes    |
| **Participants:**  | 2–20 students |
| **Instructors:**   | 1 teacher     |
| **Class:**         | tables        |
| **Resources:**     | printed cards with code snippets |
| **Prerequisites:** | read basic Python code |

## Learning outcomes

* Practice code understanding and code conventions.
* Evaluate code quality and correct it.

## Setup and preparation

* Print the [code snippets](code.pdf). Use one-sided printing.
* Cut the papers so that you have 10 snippets and the 3 categories for each group.

## Activity overview

1. Divide the students into small groups of 2--3 people.
2. Each group receives printed code snippets and three strips of paper with the categories Good, Bad, and Ugly.
3. The task of the group is to cooperatively divide the snippets into the three categories.
	* The good: functional code that runs correctly and is written 'nicely' (according to style guides).
	* The bad: code that contains a syntactical, semantical, or logical error.
	* The ugly: functional code that, however, does not follow programming conventions.
	* If a code is bad or ugly, the additional task is to correct it.
4. When everyone is finished, pair the groups so that they can compare and discuss their choices.

## Tips and tricks

* This activity can be easily extended with more snippets of varying difficulty (one or two lines, short functions, or larger blocks of code).
* The number of good, bad, and ugly snippets need not be roughly equal. For example, you can have 10, 5, and 3 in each category, respectively. This might make the activity harder, as the students would expect equal division.

* [Pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint) and [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) are useful tools to check code quality.

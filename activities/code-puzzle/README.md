# Code puzzle

The students form small groups and cooperatively join small pieces of code into the complete one. In other words, they solve a [Parson's problem](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1151890).

| Parameters:        |               |
| -----------------: | :------------ |
| **Duration:**      | 20 minutes    |
| **Participants:**  | 3-18 students |
| **Instructors:**   | 1 teacher     |
| **Class:**         | tables        |
| **Resources:**     | printed pieces of a code |
| **Prerequisites:** | read basic C# code |

## Learning outcomes

* Practice code conventions and code understanding.
* Practice teamwork.

## Setup and preparation

* Print the code parts [1](code-part1.png), [2](code-part2.png), [3](code-part3.png) for each group. Use one-sided printing.
* Cut the papers.

## Activity overview

1. Divide the students into groups of 2--3 people.
2. Each group receives printed code parts.
3. The task of the group is to cooperatively join the parts into the complete code.
	* Warning: There are several distractors -- code parts that shouldn't be used.
4. When the group is finished, pair it with another finished one so they can compare and discuss their choices.

## Tips and tricks

* Put the pieces of code for each group into the envelopes, so that it is easier to reuse this activity. It also reduces the chance of loss of some pieces.
* If you are not sure which part is correct, you can check the solution ([C# source](solution.cs) or a [plain text file](solution.txt)).

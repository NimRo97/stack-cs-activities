# Stages of cyber attacks

Match the four stages of a cyber attack with their definitions and examples.

| Parameters:        |              |
| -----------------: | :----------- |
| **Duration:**      | 10 minutes   |
| **Participants:**  | 1â€“X students |
| **Instructors:**   | 1 teacher    |
| **Class:**         | any          |
| **Resources:**     | printed and cut cards |
| **Prerequisites:** | basic understanding of the terms on the cards |

## Learning outcomes

* Remember the four stages of a cyber attack.
* Understand the definitions of the attack stages.
* Name the example tools that can be used during the attack stages.

## Setup and preparation

* Print the [handout](cyber-attacks.pdf) for each student group.
	* Use one-sided printing.
* Cut the handout into cards so that each line forms one card. You will be left with 4 phase cards, 4 definition cards, and 21 tool cards for each student group.
* Mix the cards and pin each set together with a paperclip. This will avoid the hassle with distribution.

## Activity overview

1. The students create small groups (2 to 3 students).
2. Each group receives one set of cards and has to match the phases with their definitions and then assign example tools to each.
3. When two neighboring students are finished, ask them to compare their solutions and discuss any differences.
4. Allow time for questions, or let the students explain the individual tools.
5. Solution:
	* In the handout, the definitions are listed in the order of the phases, so the 1st definition belongs to the 1st phase, and so on.
	* The first 6 tools (Google, ..., phishing) belong to phase 1.
	* The next 4 tools (nmap, ..., WPScan) belong to phase 2.
	* The next 7 tools (Metasploit, ..., password cracking) belong to phase 3.
	* The last 4 tools (ransomware, ..., adware) belong to phase 4.

## Tips and tricks

* Make sure that the students understand the definitions and the terms in the tools, and are not just guessing.

# Network flow monitoring

The activity starts with a brief reading about the concept of network flows. Each student then receives cards that represent packets and groups them into flows.

| Parameters:        |                                  |
| -----------------: | :------------------------------- |
| **Duration:**      | 15 minutes                       |
| **Participants:**  | 1â€“N students (unlimited)         |
| **Instructors:**   | 1 teacher                        |
| **Class:**         | tables                           |
| **Resources:**     | printed handout for each student |
| **Prerequisites:** | basic concepts of networks (packet, IP address, port, protocol) |

## Learning outcomes

* Explain what a network flow is.
* Remember and name the five basic components of network flow, along with at least three extensions.
* Argue why it's more practical to store and analyze flows over individual packets. 

## Setup and preparation

* Print the [activity handout](flow-exercise-handout.pdf) for each student.
	* Use one-sided printing.
	* There is one page with theory and exercise setting, one page with the solution, and two pages for the packet cards.
	* Cut the packet cards so that there are 24 paper strips for each student.
* Make sure that each student has free space on a table.

## Activity overview

* Give the printed handout, along with the packet cards, to each student.
* Instruct the students to read the handout and then proceed to the activity in their own pace.
* When you notice two or three neighboring students who finished, have them make small groups to compare their solutions.

## Tips and tricks

* Some students tend to be quite fast. After the activity, ask them to share their strategy with the whole group.
* The first two pages can be printed two-sided, but the last two pages with the packet cards must be one-sided.

## Related material

* The initial version of the activity originated in a [Master's thesis](https://is.muni.cz/th/yqkg2/?lang=en). The attached ZIP file contains prepared lecture slides and handouts to cover more information about flows.

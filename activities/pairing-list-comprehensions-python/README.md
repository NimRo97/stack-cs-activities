# Pairing students based on list comprehensions

Pair students for a subsequent activity by handing them cards with list comprehension expressions. A student forms a pair with the one who has a Python list comprehension that generates the same list.

| Parameters:        |               |
| -----------------: | :------------ |
| **Duration:**      | 5 minutes     |
| **Participants:**  | 8–16 students |
| **Instructors:**   | 1 teacher     |
| **Class:**         | any           |
| **Resources:**     | printed paper strips |
| **Prerequisites:** | reading list comprehensions in Python |

## Learning outcomes

* Practice understanding list comprehensions in Python.

## Setup and preparation

* Print and cut the [cards](cards.pdf) so that you have 16 strips. (Use one-sided printing.)

## Activity overview

1. Let each student randomly pick one paper strip.
2. Their task is to find their pair.
3. Afterward, you can follow with another team activity, such as [The good, the bad, and the ugly](activities/good-bad-ugly/README.md).

## Tips and tricks

* This activity can be easily generalized. The same principle is employed in [Pairing students based on file commands](activities/pairing-file-commands-python/README.md).

## Related material

* There are many similar pairing activities in the [author's GitHub](https://github.com/horacekj/ib111-deleni). The description is in Czech, but it doesn't matter for most activities, as they usually involve code.

\textbf{A. Computational thinking and algorithms}
& I don't know what's an algorithm or I don't know how to design them. & &
& If I have enough time or help, I can design a simple algorithm. However, I often make a mistake or get stuck. & & 
& I can think computationally and express the steps of an algorithm in code. & & 
& I can devise and understand different approaches to solving a problem and compare their advantages, disadvantages, and effectiveness. CLRS is my favorite book. \\ \hline

\textbf{B. Data structures}
& I don't know or can't use data structures. & &
& I know basic data structures, such as a list, and I tried using them. & & 
& I know and can use a list, dictionary, and simple objects in Python. & & 
& I know in detail the implementation and internal representation of data structures. I understand the time and space complexity of the individual operations and consider it while programming. \\ \hline

\textbf{C. Functions}
& I don't know how to divide code into functions. & &
& I can write a simple function without a return value. & & 
& I can divide a problem into several independent functions, which employ their return values. & & 
& I suitably decompose the whole program into functions, my code is readable. My functions have a single responsibility and a clear contract. \\ \hline

\textbf{D. Working with errors}
& I'm afraid of errors in code. I can't fix the code if it contains errors. & &
& I can fix simple syntactic errors (such as a missing parenthesis), but I usually need help with other errors. & & 
& I understand error messages in Python and can individually fix common syntactic, semantic, and logical bugs. & & 
& I also understand someone else's code. Even if the source of the bug is complex, I can help my colleagues/classmates. \\ \hline

\textbf{E. Documentation}
& I've never read an official documentation. & &
& I've read an official Python documentation, but sometimes it's hard for me to navigate in it. & & 
& If I don't understand what a function does in Python, I find its official documentation, read it, and then I'm able to use the function correctly. & & 
& I know the criteria for a quality documentation and I wrote one myself. \\ \hline

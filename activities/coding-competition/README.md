# Coding Competition

Students solve a set of easy practice problems in programming lectures or labs. If a student solves a task, (s)he stands up and marks it on a whiteboard. At the end of the competition, students present correct solutions to each task.

| **Instructors:**   | 1 teacher                           |
| **Class:**         | PCs, whiteboard                     |
| **Resources:**     | set of easy programming tasks       |
| **Prerequisites:** | depend on the chosen task           |

## Learning outcomes

* Students practice coding under time pressure.
* Students practice explaining and comparing their solutions to others.

## Setup and preparation

* Prepare a (printed) document with 8-12 easy programming tasks related to a lecture topic. Solving each task should take an average student at most 5 minutes.
* Prepare a huge table on a whiteboard, with one row for each student and one column for each task.
 
## Activity overview

* Before the start: Teacher explains the competition rules. Students fill their own names (nicknames) in the table on the whiteboard (reduce a shame).
* During the competition: Each student solves all tasks individually. Upon solving a task, (s)he marks it in the table. The teacher measures time and regurally informs students how many minutes they have left. 
* After the competition: According to the table, the teacher randomly picks some students to present their solution. The student is not examined by a teacher, (s)he talks directly to the class and explains how (s)he solved the problem. Other students can ask questions or offer their ideas. One presentation takes at most 1 minute including questions. The winner is rewarded by candy or bonus points.

## Tips and tricks

* This activity can be made shorter if you use fewer tasks.
* To motivate also weaker students, there should be at least two very simple tasks in the set. You should avoid too difficult tasks.
* In the table, students can mark an order in which they solved each task. This allows more precise evaluation of the competition.
* Instead of a whiteboard, you can use a shared online document. This eliminates the physical activity and makes the environment more calm.
* If a student does not want to present his/her solution, do not force him/her.

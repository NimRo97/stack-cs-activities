# State diagram created together

The goal of this activity is to practice creating a state diagram on a particular assignment of a specified use case. The diagram is being created step-by-step on a whiteboard by all students.

| Parameters:        |                                     |

| **Instructors:**   | 1 teacher    |
| **Class:**         | classroom with a whiteboard and projector                  |
| **Resources:**     | presentation       |
| **Prerequisites:** | state diagram theoretical knowledge |

## Learning outcomes

* Practical training of state diagram development.
* Explain and reason about the diagram with the others.

## Activity overview

* Preparation
  * Let students read the [task](task.pdf) and make sure they understand it.
* Creation
  * Students go one by one to the whiteboard and make a piece of the diagram.
  * After each part, ask the rest of the class if they are OK with it, or how would they change it.
* Conclusion
  * Let students take a photo of the created state diagram if they want.
  * Optionally summarize the activity and emphasize the errors that were made.

## Tips and tricks

* Be aware of the space on the whiteboard. Adjust the created pieces of the diagram based on it. You can check the attached [solution](solution.pdf) to help you with it.
* If the student makes a mistake, you don't need to correct it immediately, but let the other students find it.
* Students don't need to come to the whiteboard in a row, you can pick them randomly to surprise them.
* There is no need to pick every student, the others will be included by the correction process after each student at the whiteboard.
* You do not need to end with the exact diagram as in [solution](solution.pdf). However, it has to make sense.

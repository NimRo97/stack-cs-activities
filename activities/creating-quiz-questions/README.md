# Creating quiz questions

In this homework activity, the students create quiz questions in small groups to practice concepts discussed in class. The quality of the questions is then checked by other students. The resulting questions can be used on the final exam.

| Parameters:        |              |
| -----------------: | :----------- |
| **Duration:**      | 60 minutes   |
| **Participants:**  | 4–X students |
| **Instructors:**   | 1 teacher    |
| **Class:**         | any          |
| **Resources:**     | a computer with internet connection |
| **Prerequisites:** | some content was already covered in the class |

## Learning outcomes

* Revise and better understand the content covered in class.
* Try the role of an examiner who creates test questions.
* Give and receive feedback on the created questions.

## Setup and preparation

* (Optional) Create a shared space (such as a Google Doc folder) for the students to upload their questions.

## Activity overview

1. The students create small groups so that the total number of groups is even.
2. Each group has to create a small number (around 5) quiz questions that test the understanding of a given concept.
  * The topic and the reference can be the last lecture/lab/seminar or a few pages from literature.
  * The questions can be multiple choice or with an open answer.
3. The group writes the questions online \(for example, in a Google Document\).
4. The group shares the questions with another group to receive feedback on the quality of the questions.
  * Each group receives feedback from one group and gives feedback to one group.
  * The feedback can focus on the correctness of the question, understandability, wording, feasibility of choices, and so on.
5. Based on the feedback, the group updates the questions.
6. The teacher checks the resulting questions and suggests changes.
  * This takes about 1 minute for 1 question.
7. In the next class, do a brief (10 minutes) follow-up discussion to answer questions such as:
  * What have you learned while creating the questions?
  * What have you discovered when checking the questions of the other group?
  * Was the feedback from the other group valuable? Why or why not?

Example questions for an introductory Python programming class:
* What is the result of evaluating the expression `13 > 4*3 and not 1/3 == 0.33`? \(Free form answer\)
* Which of the following commands immediately terminates a loop? a\) continue, b\) break, c\) while, d\) for

## Tips and tricks

* This is a good practice activity before a midterm or a final exam.
* If ten pairs of students create five questions each, that's 50 questions in total. Announce that you'll pick some of them for the final exam (perhaps slightly changed so that they won't learn the answers by heart) so that they practice them.
* The students can create questions also individually, but the quality of the work is arguably higher when they work in pairs.
* The students often formulate the questions unclearly. Don't expect them to be perfect in the first iteration.
* Motivate the students by awarding points for creating good questions.

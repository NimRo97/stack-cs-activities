# Data types in Python

Each student receives cards with names of data types and cards with expressions. The goal is to assign the expressions to their corresponding data types.

| Parameters:        |               |
| -----------------: | :------------ |
| **Duration:**      | 10 minutes    |
| **Participants:**  | 1–20 students |
| **Instructors:**   | 1 teacher     |
| **Class:**         | tables, pens  |
| **Resources:**     | printed cards |
| **Prerequisites:** | evaluating simple expressions |

## Learning outcomes

* Realize the existence of the data type system in Python, which is implicit.
* Understand the difference between type and a concrete value/expression.
* Be able to determine the type of a given expression.

## Setup and preparation

* Print the [cards](data-types-cards.pdf) for each student.
	* The PDF contains one page with cards for 2 students.
	* Use one-sided printing.
* Cut the cards so that each student has 3 data type cards and 15 expression cards.

## Activity overview

1. Hand out the card set to all students and ask them to assign the expressions to the appropriate types. The students must not use a Python interpreter, only pen and paper.
2. When two neighboring students are finished, ask them to compare their solutions and discuss any differences.
3. Allow time for questions.

## Tips and tricks

* If a student is stuck, ask him/her to evaluate the expression to a single value.
* A brief follow-up activity can be to let the students think about as many operations as possible for the given data types, and then comparing the results with a neighbor.

# Data structures in Python

Hands-on team activity for assigning features and use cases to different data structures.

| Parameters:        |                               |
| -----------------: | :---------------------------- |
| **Duration:**      | 30 minutes                    |
| **Participants:**  | 6–30 students                 |
| **Instructors:**   | 1–X teachers (ideally 1 per 6-8 participants) |
| **Class:**         | table for each group          |
| **Resources:**     | printed activity cards        |
| **Prerequisites:** | have seen the data structures |

## Learning outcomes

* Know different data structures in Python (list, tuple, set, dictionary) and their properties.
* Justify selection of the appropriate data structure for selected use cases.

## Setup and preparation

* Print the set of [paper cards](cards.pdf) for each group.
	* Use one-sided printing.
	* If possible, print on paper of 3 different colors: names and examples of the data structures on the first, features on the second, and use cases on the third. This will help both you and the students.
	* Cut the pages into individual cards.
* Print an [answer table](key.pdf) for each instructor.

## Activity overview

1. Let people divide into groups of 3–4 people each as they see fit.
2. Give each group the cards with data structures and their features (first three pages).
	* Task for the group: *Assign given features to the data structures. If a feature applies to multiple data structures, you have it multiple times.*
	* After the group reads the features, make sure they understand all of them (especially those like mutability).
3. When a group is finished, give them the cards with real-world use cases (the last, fourth page).
	* Task for the group: *Choose the appropriate data structures for the given use cases and justify your selection.*
4. When two groups are finished, have pairs of the groups compare their selection of data structures for the given use cases. Let them justify their choice to the other group.
	* If there are enough instructors, keep one instructor with each pair of groups.
	* When relevant or asked for, offer your own opinion or extra information.
5. When everyone is finished, invite the whole class to ask further questions or give feedback on what they learned.
6. Preferably, continue with a programming exercise that practices data structures.

## Tips and tricks

* Once the groups form, work with them individually if there are enough instructors (there is no need to have them perfectly synchronized).
* If possible, convince groups that they want to use the table (as opposed to laying cards on the floor). The full matching takes quite a lot of space (and working on the floor for long tends to become uncomfortable).
* Before giving a new set of cards to a group, check their matching according to the [answer table](key.pdf). If there is enough time, have them correct their own mistake instead of pointing it out straight away.
* Group size is up to your choice, but 3–4 people turned out best (enough for discussion but still keeping everyone engaged).
* The activity will progress faster with skilled participants and slower with less skilled ones.

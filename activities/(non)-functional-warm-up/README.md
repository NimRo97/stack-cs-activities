# Non-functional warm-up

The students answer the set of questions to categorize the software requirements into functional, non-functional, or low-quality. They also state their argument, why is their opinion right.

| Parameters:        |               |
| -----------------: | :------------ |
| **Duration:**      | 10 minutes    |
| **Participants:**  | 2–20 students |
| **Instructors:**   | 1 teacher     |
| **Class:**         | any        |
| **Resources:**     | set of questions |
| **Prerequisites:** | students read about software requirements |

## Learning outcomes

* Practice the categorization of software requirements.
* Practice the disputation about the own opinion.

## Setup and preparation

* If you want to use this activity in its base form, no preparation is needed, just use the set of questions.

## Activity overview

* Questions for categorization (and their answers):
  * The application will be written in C# (non-functional)
  * The plane will be able to server Martini (functional)
  * The system can be accessed from every platform (low-quality: what is every platform?)
  * After the crash, the server will be up in 15 seconds (non-functional)
  * The machine will not take less than 1000 euro. At the same time, it will only take up to 500 euro (low-quality: does not make sense)
  * The database will be backed up every day at 23:59 (non-functional)
  * The robot will be able to hold a mouse (low-quality: which mouse?)
  * The system will provide the option to register for an exam (functional)
  * The application will be able to serve multiple users at once (low-quality: how many is multiple?)
  * The application will need GeForce GTX 660 graphics card (non-functional)
* Conclusion
  * Summarize the activity.

## Tips and tricks

* Your answers may be different from the proposed because in some cases, it is debatable. The point of this activity is to let students think about software requirements more, so sometimes the question can have multiple right answers if they defend their opinion correctly.
* This activity can be easily extended to a group activity with pieces of papers, or to Kahoot.

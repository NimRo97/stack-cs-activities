# Pairing students based on file commands

Pair students for a subsequent activity by handing them cards with commands and their descripition. Student with a command forms the pair with the one who has the description.

| Parameters:        |               |
| -----------------: | :------------ |
| **Duration:**      | 5 minutes     |
| **Participants:**  | 8–17 students |
| **Instructors:**   | 1 teacher     |
| **Class:**         | any           |
| **Resources:**     | printed paper strips |
| **Prerequisites:** | basic commands for working with files in Python |

## Learning outcomes

* Practice basic commands for working with files in Python.

## Setup and preparation

* Print and cut the [cards](cards.pdf) so that you have 17 strips. (Use one-sided printing.) There is an odd number of strips because you can have an odd number of students, so that you can create one group of 3.

## Activity overview

1. Let each student randomly pick one paper strip.
2. Their task is to find their pair.
3. Afterward, you can follow with another team activity, such as [The good, the bad, and the ugly](activities/good-bad-ugly/README.md).

## Tips and tricks

* This activity can be easily generalized. The same principle is employed in [Pairing students based on list comprehensions](activities/pairing-list-comprehensions-python/README.md).

## Related material

* There are many similar pairing activities in the [author's GitHub](https://github.com/horacekj/ib111-deleni). The description is in Czech, but it doesn't matter for most activities, as they usually involve code.

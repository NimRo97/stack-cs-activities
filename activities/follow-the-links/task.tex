\section*{Objectives}

The \textbf{objectives of this activity} are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item To become familiar with lists of lists
  \item To become familiar with algorithms involving lists
\end{itemize}

\section*{Task}

Consider the following algorithm:
\begin{verbatim}
make list of nums...
... get N
... create the list innerList with room for N elements
... create the list outerList with room for N elements
... for i from 0 to N-1...
... ... set innerList[i] to hold 0
... for i from 0 to N-1...
... ... set outerList[i] to hold innerList
... for i from 0 to N-1...
... ... for j from 0 to N-1...
... ... ... set outerList[i][j] to hold (N*i + j)
\end{verbatim}
Assume N is 4. With the materials you've been given:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create two rectangles for \texttt{innerList} and \texttt{outerList} respectively with room for four squares within them.
	\item Step through the algorithm creating links (with thread) between \texttt{innerList}/\texttt{outerList} and what their contents are.
	\item As contents change, write out the new value and then move or change the links to match.
	\item Discuss your findings with your group. 
\end{enumerate}
\textit{Note: your tutor may ask one or more of the groups in the class to report back to the whole class}

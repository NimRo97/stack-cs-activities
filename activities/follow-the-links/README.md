This activity has students learning about lists of references and prepares them for some of the most common issues students face in dealing with lists (and lists of lists). That being, creating copies of lists (or thinking they've made copies and not understanding why they are not genuinely different).

| Parameters:        |                                     |
| -----------------: | :---------------------------------- |
| **Duration:**      | 20 minutes                          |
| **Participants:**  | 4–30 students                       |
| **Instructors:**   | 1–2 teachers                        |
| **Class:**         | tables and possibly whiteboards     |
| **Resources:**     | string/twine, scissors, bluetac/equivalent, markers or squares of paper  |
| **Prerequisites:** | students should have already encountered lists to some extent |

## Learning outcomes

* Learn about mutable types and references
* Learn how to copy lists of references
* Understand nested lists
* Practice nested loops	
* Practice teamwork and communication

## Setup and preparation

* Group students into teams of 3–4
* Cut up some lengths of string for each group
* Distribute lengths of string, scissors, bluetac
* If there are whiteboards in the room, distribute markers and erasers (1 per team) otherwise distribute squares of paper students can write on
* Pass on a copy of the [algorithm](follow-the-links.pdf) to each group

## Activity overview

* Students draw up squares on white board (or use existing squares) to represent the list and list elements
* Students have squares within a list to represent cells (spots) in the list
* Using the string, students connect list positions to elements stored at those list positions
* In making changes, students follow the links to decide what changes
* Students write down values (on paper or whiteboard) as each is computed
* Students then discuss together about what was happening and why (and what to do differently in future)
* The teacher will wander around and ensure students are on track giving guidance as needed
* Few groups report back to the class

## Tips and tricks
 
* Activity is quite scalable but should be in groups of 3–4 to ensure students are invested in the group and can disengage
* Students tend to take a little while to understand exactly what's intended, you may need to show them an example with just a single reference (link of string)
* After this students tend to figure out what's happening and hence understand why you can't copy a list by assigning it to another variable

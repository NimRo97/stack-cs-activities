## Activity overview

* The instructor shows the text specification to students. 
* The students have a few minutes to read it and think about the mistakes.
* The instructor prompts the students to say a mistake out loud, along with an explanation why they think it is a mistake.
* The instructor corrects the mistake in the document/on the board and follows each report with a brief discussion on why it is a mistake and why the proposed fix is correct.
* The activity ends when all mistakes are corrected.

## Tips and tricks

* If students do not see any mistakes, you can read a sentence after sentence and ask what could be written better.
* You can show an example of a different correct use case specification to help students realize what is right and what is not.
* The activity can spark a discussion on where the mistakes are and why.

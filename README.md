# The Stack of Computer Science Teaching Activities

Teaching computer science in lecture halls? Boring! We prefer active learning methods. That's why we created the Stack: an open-source collection of teaching activities for understanding and practicing CS concepts. Each activity in the Stack features a thorough description, printable handouts, and supporting materials for teachers to easily use in their classes. For free.

## Activities

You can browse [the full list of activities](activities.md). Or just have a quick look at our **flagship activities**:

* [Encryption modes](activities/encryption-modes/README.md) -- Learn block cipher modes of operation, their properties and use cases from scratch.
* [Incident handling: A suspicious e-mail](activities/incident-handling-suspicious-email/README.md) -- Spot an e-mail scam within a corporate scenario that actually happened.

## Useful links

* [Ideas for new activities](activities-wip/ideas.md) -- Feel free to develop them!
* [External resources](knowledge-base/references.md) -- Other websites relevant for teaching CS.

## Contact us and join our efforts

Feel free to contribute your own activities (by creating a pull request). Please, use [the template for new activities](activities/README.md) and look at the flagship activities above to see an example of how the description is structured. If you are unsure about your English, we gladly accept submissions in Czech or Slovak language, too!

We also appreciate suggestions for improvement, notes on your experience, or any other comments. Please, email Valdemar at *valdemar@mail.muni.cz*.

## Contributing authors

The Stack was conceived and is maintained by [Valdemar Švábenský](https://www.fi.muni.cz/~xsvabens/), a member of the [*Teaching Lab*](https://is.muni.cz/predmet/fi/DUCIT) community at the [Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University](https://fi.muni.cz).

However, the Stack wouldn't exist without the significant contributions of other Teaching Lab members, especially Martin Ukrop and Ondráš Přibyla.

We also thank the authors of the activities (in alphabetical order): Radka Cieslarová, Jaroslav Čechák, Lukáš Daubner, Jan Horáček, Karel Kubíček, Martin Macák, Michaela Pokludová, Vlasta Šťavová, Martin Ukrop, and the CSIRT-MU team.
